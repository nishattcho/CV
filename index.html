                    I currently study Mathematics, Further Mathematics, Physics, and Computer Science
                    and I wish to study Mathematics and Computer Science at university. With my degree,
                    I hope to be able to work either in cyber security, or preferably forensic science. My
                    academic achievements in previous years prompted my nomination to be part of Harris Experience
                    Advanced (HEA), a program that provided me with exclusive opportunities to broaden my
                    horizons. My engagement in various educational opportunities has significantly contributed
                    to my proficiency in mathematics and enhanced my capacity for logical thinking.
                    Specifically, my involvement in problem-solving classes and summer school at UCL has played
                    a crucial role. Moreover, I had the privilege of being selected to participate in one
                    of Imperial College's Further mA*ths course. This intensive program provided me with
                    invaluable skills in teamwork, methodical reasoning, and analytical thinking.

                    In the past, I've found great joy in musical enrichment, leading me to explore and master
                    various instruments, including the trumpet, piano, drums, and the violin. I enjoy learning
                    new technical skills in my free time, I have taught myself how to use many of the Microsoft
                    365 functions and looking forward to putting my skills within Computer Science to use out of
                    a school environment as well.
